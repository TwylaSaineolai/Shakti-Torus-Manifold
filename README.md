The Śakti Torus Manifold (STM) is an open, Python‑based model that represents a formal dynamical image of consciousness.  It treats the individual self (jīva) as a system of interconnected oscillators evolving on a 15‑dimensional torus—five (elements,) seven (chakras,) and three (cosmic principles) coupled phase domains.  Two geometric regimes define the system’s symmetry: an offset‑triangle (asymmetric / waking) layout and a bindu‑centred (symmetric / absorptive) layout.  The STM reports two key observables—phase coherence and geometric alignment—to explore how resonant harmony, symmetry, and relative coupling relate to the emergence or dissolution of order in conscious states.  

This repository provides all simulation code, parameter sets, and documentation for studying and extending the model as a theoretical tool. It is not a spiritual or therapeutic practice; its purpose is analytical, mathematical, and contemplative.
